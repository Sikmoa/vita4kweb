## Introduction

Vita3K is an experimental PlayStation Vita emulator for Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, and the web. 

This fork includes critical bugfixes by **notawindstone** targeting the experimental WebAssembly/WebGPU browser port (`browser/`), resolving core execution and stability issues in browser environments.

## Browser Port & notawindstone Fixes

Vita3K includes an in-tree WebAssembly/WebGPU port located under `browser/`. This branch integrates bugfixes and stability improvements by **notawindstone** to ensure the web runtime initializes and runs accurately.

* **Key Fixes:** Addresses critical browser port bugs, WebAssembly memory/threading quirks, and WebGPU pipeline synchronization issues.
* **Architecture:** See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) to understand how the browser components interface with core Vita3K modules.
* **Building & Testing:** Consult [SCRIPTS.md](./SCRIPTS.md) for web-specific build, serve, and testing steps.

## Compatibility

The emulator currently runs many homebrew titles and commercial games. Web port compatibility may vary compared to native desktop builds depending on browser WebGPU support.
