// Memory64 overrides all wasm32-specific signatures below: state/metadata
// pointers are i64, guest operands and results remain i32, and env.memory is
// the runtime's unshared Memory64 memory. REGION_ABI.md defines both modes.

// Emits a Wasm module importing env.memory (unshared, min 1 page in wasm32;
// fixed Memory64 limits in the opt-in wasm64 mode) and env.mem_read/
// env.mem_write: (host state pointer, guest address i32, bytes i32)->i32.
// Helpers are noexcept native Wasm functions: 0=success, 2=fault. Read fills
// memory_value in little-endian order; write consumes it. Only the low `bytes`
// bytes are significant. On failure helpers set fault_address/fault_write.
// The module exports block: (host pointer) -> i32 reason. Its pointer parameter
// is i32 in the existing wasm32 ABI and i64 in Memory64; it is passed through
// Emscripten's native function-table ABI. The pointer must address a live
// JitState in that memory; out-of-bounds accesses trap.
//
// EMPTY vector means unsupported IR/terminal/location or exceeded limits; no
// partial module is returned. No guest instructions execute during emission.
// Supported modules return after ONE block (no chaining). Each invocation
// overwrites executed, exit_reason and svc; regs[15] is the next guest PC.
// Svc returns AFTER the frontend's post-SVC PC write, leaving handling to host.
// Memory IR is accepted ONLY for CycleCount()==1, so the dispatcher must retry
// unsupported multi-instruction blocks with a single-instruction translation.
// A failing memory helper returns Fault with executed=0 and the instruction PC.
// Parent MUST snapshot/restore architectural regs/CPSR/FPU on Fault (not the
// fault fields). Earlier stores of a multi-access instruction may have completed.
//
// M15 inline memory fast path: when the metadata bases are populated (any 0=off),
// 1/2/4-byte A32 memory IR lowers INLINE instead of calling the checked helpers.
// wasm32 performs the existing page-table lookup + permission/refcount probe +
// direct load/store against sparse backing. Memory64 keeps the permission and
// refcount probe but widens the guest i32 only at the final fixed-window address
// construction; it does not load a physical page-table entry. The fast path is
// taken only
// when it is provably equivalent to the checked path: fast-path disabled,
// guest page 0 (the checked path rejects addr < host_page_size even when a
// sparse backing was force-allocated there), page-crossing access, unmapped
// page, missing Read/Write permission and stores into code-tracked pages all
// fall back to the imported checked helper with identical fault semantics.
// Fallback reasons are encoded in the high byte of the helper's
// `bytes` argument (1=unmapped, 2=perms, 3=cross-page, 4=code page, 5=other);
// the helper masks them off before use. Fast successes increment
// mem_fast_reads/mem_fast_writes in JitState. Alignment is never checked:
// Wasm unaligned access is a little-endian byte-wise access, exactly the
// semantics of mem_read/mem_write copies; narrow loads are zero-extending,
// matching every A32/ReadMemoryN producer (sign extension is separate IR).
// No guest data address is ever used as a host offset OUTSIDE this probe: the
// generated code never dereferences a page-table entry without validating the
// mapped page first.
//
