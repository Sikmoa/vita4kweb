# SCRIPTS.md — Wasm JIT build, test & benchmark commands

Working directory: repository root. Configured Emscripten trees are `build/web`
(wasm32) and `build/web64` (Memory64); see `browser/runtime_wasmjit.cmake`.
The `EM_CACHE` paths below are specific to this development host: its system
cache supplies wasm32 libraries, while `.vscratch/emcache` supplies wasm64.

## Build & run the backend test (fast path, regions, SMC, memory matrix)

```sh
env EM_CACHE=/usr/share/emscripten/cache cmake --build build/web --target vita3k_jit_backend_test_node -j2
node build/web/browser/vita3k_jit_backend_test_node.js
```

Compiles `vita3k/cpu/tests/wasmjit_backend_test.cpp` (which includes the backend
`wasm_jit_cpu.cpp` so it can call the checked helpers directly) to a Node
executable and runs it in Node's Wasm engine. Expected last line:
`WasmJit backend: <N> checks passed (real memory, no interpreter)` (currently
over 13 million checks; the count grows with coverage). Includes the direct-
emitter P/K/PK x fast-bases matrix and inline lock/unlock tests;
also run with `VITA3K_WASMJIT_PROMOTE_FLAGS=0` to cover the reference
process default, and with `VITA3K_WASMJIT_SLOW_REASONS=1` to cover the
diagnostic slow-reason shape.

### Memory64 backend and cooperative-runtime suites (Chromium)

The local Node 22 cannot instantiate these Memory64 executables. Use the
classic-executable Chromium runner instead of treating that as a test failure:

```sh
env EM_CACHE=/home/user/.vscratch/emcache cmake --build build/web64 \
  --target vita3k_jit_backend_test_node vita3k_guest_thread_tests -j2
export PLAYWRIGHT_MODULE_URL=file://$PWD/build/playwright/node_modules/playwright/index.mjs
node browser/tests/wasm_executable_chromium.mjs vita3k_jit_backend_test_node 'WasmJit backend:'
node browser/tests/wasm_executable_chromium.mjs vita3k_guest_thread_tests \
  'Guest thread exceptions: diagnostics, failure accounting and clean teardown passed'
```

The runner checks aborts, page errors, exit status and the supplied success
marker. `WASM_TEST_DIST` overrides `build/web64/browser`. For wasm32, build the
same two targets in `build/web` with the system cache and run their `.js` files
in Node. The runtime suite includes real mutex park/wake, cancellation,
timeouts, deletion/reuse, multiple dirty-owner commits and exception teardown.
The inline-mutex regression suites intentionally require acceleration enabled;
use the retail ablation below for a disabled-path performance comparison.

## Emitter fixture suite (real Dynarmic IR → Wasm modules, run in Node)

```sh
cmake -S external/dynarmic -B build/native-dynarmic -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DDYNARMIC_FRONTENDS=A32 -DDYNARMIC_TESTS=OFF -DDYNARMIC_USE_BUNDLED_EXTERNALS=ON \
  '-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-DFMT_CONSTEVAL= -Wno-deprecated-literal-operator' \
  -DDYNARMIC_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS=OFF
cmake --build build/native-dynarmic
bash vita3k/cpu/tests/build_wasmjit_fp_helper.sh /tmp/wasmjit-fp-helper.wasm
c++ -std=c++20 -O1 -DFMT_CONSTEVAL= -Wno-deprecated-literal-operator \
  -Ivita3k/cpu/include -Ivita3k/mem/include \
  -Iexternal/dynarmic/src \
  -Iexternal/dynarmic/externals/mcl/include \
  -Iexternal/dynarmic/externals/fmt/include -Iexternal/boost \
  vita3k/cpu/src/wasmjit/emit_wasm.cpp \
  vita3k/cpu/tests/wasmjit_emitter_test.cpp \
  vita3k/cpu/src/wasmjit/fp64.cpp /tmp/wasmjit-fp-helper.wasm.fused.cpp \
  build/native-dynarmic/src/dynarmic/libdynarmic.a \
  build/native-dynarmic/externals/mcl/src/libmcl.a \
  build/native-dynarmic/externals/fmt/libfmt.a \
  build/native-dynarmic/externals/zydis/libZydis.a \
  build/native-dynarmic/externals/zydis/zycore/libZycore.a \
  -o /tmp/wasmjit-emitter-test
/tmp/wasmjit-emitter-test /tmp/wasmjit-emitter-fixtures
node vita3k/cpu/tests/wasmjit_emitter_test.mjs /tmp/wasmjit-emitter-fixtures \
  /tmp/wasmjit-fp-helper.wasm
```

The first two commands build a standalone native Dynarmic (with its x64
backend, which runs the vitaslop cases as the oracle for the flags their
goldens do not record) and its bundled fmt; the headers must be that fmt
(`external/fmt` is a different version and does not link). Then the native fixture generator is built (no CMake target
exists for it; see `vita3k/cpu/tests/wasmjit_emitter_README.md`), translates
real ARM/Thumb into `.wasm` fixtures with expected-state JSON, and Node executes
every module. Expected last line: `Wasm execution passed: ...`.

The FP helper build requires Emscripten and CMake. Node executes the real
portable arithmetic compiled to Wasm through a WASI reactor; it does not use
JavaScript arithmetic as the oracle for the extended FP operations. The
native fixture generator links the same corrected FMA source before the
Dynarmic archive. The fmt flags above accommodate modern Clang with the
vendored fmt version.

If the external vitaslop corpus is unavailable, pass `--core-only` as the
generator's second argument to explicitly omit it. The default still requires
that corpus. See [IR_COVERAGE.md](vita3k/cpu/src/wasmjit/IR_COVERAGE.md) for the
portable opcode scope, native callback exclusions and validation limits.

## Audio audibility probe (square-wave homebrew through the Worker path)

```sh
PLAYWRIGHT_MODULE_URL=file://$PWD/build/playwright/node_modules/playwright/index.mjs \
  node browser/tests/audio_fixture_chromium.mjs
```

Builds a genuine VitaSDK homebrew that outputs 40 full-scale 440 Hz stereo
buffers through production `sceAudioOut` HLE, runs it through the wasm64
Worker (`run-vita`), and asserts exit code 7 with 40 chunks at peak 16000.
Expected last line: `AUDIO PATH AUDIBLE: 40 full-scale chunks through
HLE->worker->page`. A passing probe with silent retail PCM means the game
emits silence (e.g. still on a loading screen with no input), not that the
page drops sound. The headless Limbo harness (`limbo_app_chromium.mjs`)
reports aggregate PCM `audio` (chunks/bytes/peak/nonzero/freqs) for the same
separation, and the dev page shows a rolling `peak=` in its stats line.

## Exit-42 homebrew fixture (end-to-end JIT, cold start)

```sh
cmake --build build/web --target vita3k_jit_fixture_node -j 8
node build/web/browser/vita3k_jit_fixture_node.js browser/tests/vita_homebrew_fixture/eboot.bin
```

Runs the real VitaSDK eboot through the JIT. Expect `[bench] exit=42`,
`imports=23`, `missing_nids=0`.

## Interpreter instruction tests (oracle stays green)

```sh
cmake --build build/web --target vita3k_web_interpreter_tests -j 8
node build/web/browser/vita3k_web_interpreter_tests.js
```

Expected: `M3 interpreter checks passed`.

## Display-homebrew benchmark (steady-state FPS, JIT)

```sh
cmake --build build/web --target vita3k_display_bench_jit
```

Builds the ASYNCIFY Node bench module AND runs it — the target is both build
and run. The `[display-bench] JSON {...}` line contains `fps`,
`instructionsPerSec` and the JIT profile (`fast_reads`, `fast_writes`,
`slow_*` fallback-reason counters). Interpreter variant:
`--target vita3k_display_bench_interp`.

For CPU-throughput measurement (not vblank-capped FPS), drive the module
directly with the fast-vblank headroom mode:
```sh
VITA3K_FAST_VBLANK=1 node browser/tests/display_bench_node.mjs \
  build/web/browser/vita3k_display_bench_jit_node.js \
  build/web/browser/tests/vita_display_fixture/eboot-short.bin jit
```
Guest work is identical (60 frames, 156399069 instructions, exit 77);
steady `instructionsPerSec` (~330 MIPS Node) and the `run_js_ms` profile
field (pure Wasm dispatch time) are the CPU signals. The box is noisy
(±15% run-to-run): stage each variant under its own directory (the
Emscripten glue hardcodes the `.wasm` filename), run A/B interleaved
with alternating order and `nice -n -15`, compare medians over ≥8
samples each, and require consistent pair agreement for large claims.

## CPU profiling the JIT bench (V8 sampling profiler, no code changes)

```sh
node --cpu-prof --cpu-prof-dir=/tmp/prof browser/tests/display_bench_node.mjs \
  build/web/browser/vita3k_display_bench_jit_node.js \
  build/web/browser/tests/vita_display_fixture/eboot-short.bin jit
```

Writes `/tmp/prof/CPU.*.cpuprofile` — opens in Chrome DevTools (Performance →
Load profile) or VS Code. Useful because each generated region module is a
dynamically compiled script with its own `wasm://wasm/<hash>` URL, so guest
code time is separable from host C++ time. The host module is a minified
Emscripten build without a Wasm name section, so frames appear as anonymous
`wasm-function[N]`; attribute them with:

```sh
wasm-objdump -d build/web/browser/vita3k_display_bench_jit_node.wasm > /tmp/host.dis
```

then map each hot function index (`func[N]`) to its code range and fingerprint
it by its `i32.const`/load/store mix (JitState field offsets, page masks).
Baseline shape (2026-09-15, light-dispatch build): host module 44% self time
(run loop 17.7%, state movers ~11%, region lookup 3.8%), generated region
modules 24%, Wasm↔JS trampolines 7%, timers 6%, idle (ASYNCIFY vblank) 4.5%.

## Browser (Playwright) smokes

```sh
node browser/tests/jit_smoke.mjs                      # M14 suite in a real Worker (35 checks)
node browser/tests/jit_fixture_smoke.mjs              # exit-42 fixture through the Worker path
PLAYWRIGHT_MODULE_URL=file://$PWD/build/playwright/node_modules/playwright/index.mjs \
  node browser/tests/worker_smoke.mjs build/web/dist  # full display page, visual output
PLAYWRIGHT_MODULE_URL=file://$PWD/build/playwright/node_modules/playwright/index.mjs \
  node browser/tests/dist_chromium.mjs build/web64/dist  # dist served as static files
```

All exit 0 on success. Playwright lives under `build/playwright`.
`dist_chromium.mjs` checks a deployment: the Worker, asked for the dist's memory
model (`DIST_MEMORY=w32` for a wasm32 build's dist), must load its module, and
GXM must initialise from `dist/shaders/`.

## Manual browser testing (the animated display fixture)

```sh
cmake --build build/web --target vita3k_web_dist    # modules + web files -> build/web/dist
cd build/web/dist && python3 -m http.server 8080
```

`vita3k_web_dist` (also part of the default build) produces the complete
deployable directory; serve it as-is.

Open <http://localhost:8080/display.html?backend=jit> for the JIT and
`display.html` (no query) for the interpreter. No COOP/COEP headers needed (no
SharedArrayBuffer). The Worker's console prints the JIT profile line ending in
`fast_reads=... fast_writes=...` — its presence proves the fast-path build.

## Retail app (Limbo) in a browser

```sh
cmake --build build/web64 --target vita3k_web_dist
HOST=0.0.0.0 PORT=5173 node browser/tests/limbo_serve.mjs
```

Open the printed URL (add `?auto=1` to start on load). The page stages
`.limbo_work/stage` (`LIMBO_STAGE`, `LIMBO_TITLE`, `LIMBO_APP`) into the Worker
and boots the app with the same Worker messages the headless probe uses. The
runtime files come from `browser/tests/runtime_routes.mjs`, shared with the
probes: `browser/web` from source, everything else from the built dist
`GXM_RUNTIME_DIST` (default `build/web64/dist`), including the shader
toolchain in `dist/shaders/` (GXP compiler, Naga, WASI shim; configuring the
build runs `npm ci` on `browser/shaders/package-lock.json`, so it needs npm and
the registry or an npm cache).
`LIMBO_AOT=<file>` supplies an AOT module (below). The option list is the
header of `limbo_serve.mjs`; the ones that change what is measured:

- vblank runs at real 60 Hz by default; `?fastvblank=1` free-runs it (headroom,
  not real-time speed), `?fpsHack=1` is Vita3K's fps-hack (display waits use
  one vblank).
- `?scale=N` sets the internal resolution (1-4, default 2).
- `?surfaceSync=1` reads rendered surfaces back into guest memory (see
  `browser/tests/GXM_WEBGPU.md`); off by default.
- `?memory=w64|w32|auto`, `?backend=jit|interp`, `?inlineMutex=0`.
- `?present=readback` reads every frame back to a page canvas (for
  `limbo_watch.mjs`); by default the Worker presents to a transferred
  OffscreenCanvas.

A guest message dialog (`sceMsgDialog`) is drawn over the screen and answered
with the keys; a guest on-screen keyboard (`SceIme`) is a text field over the
screen (Enter presses its enter key, Escape closes it). Restart the Node server after editing its inline page or the staged content;
runtime files are read per request.

Rendering: the runtime encodes each GXM command list as a GXS1 scene stream
(`browser/src/gxm_webgpu_bridge.cpp`) that `browser/web/gxm_scene.js` executes
in the Worker. Render targets stay on the GPU and are presented from there; see
`browser/tests/GXM_WEBGPU.md`.

**WebGPU needs a secure origin.** `navigator.gpu` exists only in secure
contexts: serve through a TLS reverse proxy or open `http://localhost:<PORT>/`
over a forwarded port. The page names this reason when it applies. A Chromium
without a usable GPU needs `--enable-unsafe-webgpu --enable-unsafe-swiftshader`.

`browser/tests/limbo_watch.mjs` runs the same page headless and mirrors frames
to `.limbo_work/live/` (`latest.png`, `frame_NNNNN.png`, `status.json`).

### Headless probe

```sh
PLAYWRIGHT_MODULE_URL=file://$PWD/build/playwright/node_modules/playwright/index.mjs \
  LIMBO_DEADLINE_MS=90000 node browser/tests/limbo_app_chromium.mjs
```

Exit 0 requires at least one presented frame; `LIMBO_DEADLINE_MS` bounds the
observation window. The JSON reports frames, exit and errors separately, plus
the renderer's `gxmSceneStats`, `gxmFailures` and `gxmSkips`. The option list
is the file header; commonly used:

- `LIMBO_GPU=1 LIMBO_HEADED=1` (with `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE`) uses the
  hardware adapter; headless Chrome only has SwiftShader.
- `LIMBO_FAST_VBLANK=0` paces vblank at 60 Hz (the probe free-runs by default).
- `LIMBO_FPS_HACK=1`, `LIMBO_SCALE=N`, `LIMBO_SURFACE_SYNC=1`: as `?fpsHack=1`,
  `?scale=N`, `?surfaceSync=1`.
- `LIMBO_DIALOG=cross|circle|none` answers every guest message dialog
  (default `cross`); `LIMBO_IME=<text>` types the text into every guest
  on-screen keyboard and presses Enter (unset: left open).
- `LIMBO_TEXTURE_VERIFY=1` checks cached textures and vertex streams against
  guest memory and logs writes the tracking missed (`[gxm-verify]`).
- `LIMBO_INPUT="<ms>:<input>[+<input>]:<hold ms>,..."` scripts pad input.
- `LIMBO_MEASURE=1` runs the fixed loading/gameplay measurement scenario with a
  Worker CPU profile per window; `LIMBO_PROFILE=0` keeps the windows without the
  profiler, `LIMBO_PROFILE=alloc` samples allocations instead;
  `LIMBO_PROFILE_OUT=<prefix>` writes the raw profiles.
- `LIMBO_LOG_OUT=<file>` keeps the worker log tail; `LIMBO_INLINE_MUTEX=0` is
  the inline-mutex ablation (see
  [`INLINE_MUTEX.md`](vita3k/cpu/src/wasmjit/INLINE_MUTEX.md)).

Raw assets, frames and logs stay in the ignored `.limbo_work/`.

### Page-bridge and offline-network fixtures

```sh
cmake --build build/web64 --target vita3k_web_dist vita3k_vita_msg_dialog_fixture \
  vita3k_vita_ime_fixture vita3k_vita_net_offline_fixture
node browser/tests/msg_dialog_chromium.mjs   # sceMsgDialog: probe answers and page keys
node browser/tests/ime_chromium.mjs          # SceIme: LIMBO_IME and the page text field
node browser/tests/net_offline_chromium.mjs  # SceNet/SceNetCtl on the offline stack
```

Each stages a genuine VitaSDK fixture as an app (with `PLAYWRIGHT_MODULE_URL`
as above) and checks its exit code. The browser has no host sockets: SceNet
runs on `vita3k/net/include/net/offline_socket.h`, a Vita without a
connection (loopback only, no route, no DNS). SceRegMgr reads come from the
staged firmware's `os0/kd/registry.db0`; without it they return 0, as desktop
Vita3K does without firmware.

## Ahead-of-time module (AOT) for a retail app

The Node app bench (`vita3k_web_app_bench`, no GPU: `VITA3K_NULL_GPU=1`) loads
the app like the browser does and builds, records seeds for, or runs an AOT
module. Format and policy: [`AOT.md`](vita3k/cpu/src/wasmjit/AOT.md).

```sh
cmake --build build/web64 --target vita3k_web_app_bench
mkdir -p .limbo_work/aot
# 1. Record the blocks the lazy JIT executes, driving the title into gameplay.
VITA3K_NULL_GPU=1 VITA3K_BENCH_SECONDS=120 VITA3K_AOT_SEEDS_OUT=.limbo_work/aot/seeds.txt \
  VITA3K_BENCH_INPUT="30000:cross:200,40000:lstick-right:5000" \
  node build/web64/browser/vita3k_web_app_bench.js .limbo_work/stage PCSE00268
# 2. Build the module from the loaded modules plus those seeds.
VITA3K_NULL_GPU=1 VITA3K_AOT_BUILD=.limbo_work/aot/limbo.aot.wasm VITA3K_AOT_SEEDS=.limbo_work/aot/seeds.txt \
  node build/web64/browser/vita3k_web_app_bench.js .limbo_work/stage PCSE00268
# 3. Use it in Node (VITA3K_AOT), or in the probe and the dev server (LIMBO_AOT).
VITA3K_NULL_GPU=1 VITA3K_AOT=.limbo_work/aot/limbo.aot.wasm \
  node build/web64/browser/vita3k_web_app_bench.js .limbo_work/stage PCSE00268
LIMBO_AOT=.limbo_work/aot/limbo.aot.wasm node browser/tests/limbo_serve.mjs
```

AOT is on by default for every staged title that has an image: put one
`<TITLE>.aot.wasm` per title in a directory and serve it with `LIMBO_AOT_DIR`
(the single-file `LIMBO_AOT` remains as the default title's override).
`player-config.json` then reports `aotUrl: /aot/<TITLE>.wasm` per title and
the player passes it to run-app; images are revalidated (304) like the
single file. The single-homebrew run-vita path (display fixtures, JIT
smokes) builds and loads the same way via `VITA3K_AOT_BUILD` / `VITA3K_AOT`
on its bench modules. Rebuild every image after a runtime change that bumps
`aot_version` (`wasm_jit_cpu.h`); stale images log `AOT REJECTED` with the
reason and fall back to the lazy JIT.

`VITA3K_BENCH_INPUT` uses the probe's `LIMBO_INPUT` syntax. Every run logs
`AOT on`, `off` or `REJECTED` with the reason: a module built from other game
code or an older AOT format version is refused and has to be rebuilt.

## Debugging generated Wasm

```sh
VITA3K_DUMP_JIT=1 node <any JIT node target>
```

Dumps each generated single-block module to `/tmp/jit-module.wasm` and region
modules to `/tmp/jit-region-*.wasm` for inspection with
`new WebAssembly.Module(fs.readFileSync(...))` in Node.
